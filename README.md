What is Qubit?

Using the concept of superposition, we can store both states 0 and 1 at the same point of time.

# Day - 2

## Language for programming quantum computing - IBM OpenQASM
ToolKit for working on Quantum computers - Qiskit

Quantum computers can be used in 2 ways
1. Simulators
2. Real Device

Trapped-ion technology is used to extract the electrons from the atoms.

```python

```


Recommended Book: [The Vibration Universe](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3823502-the-vibrating-universe)

Based on the quantum physics, the electron is continually spins and it spins in two driections at a point of time.
